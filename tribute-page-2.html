        <p>King Crimson are a progressive rock band formed in 1968 in London, England.
         The band draws inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements
         of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, industrial, electronic, experimental
         music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock
         movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent
          generations of artists across multiple genres. The band has earned a large cult following.</p>

          <p>Founded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and lyricist Peter Sinfield,
             the band initially focused on a dramatic sound layered with Mellotron strings, McDonald’s
             saxophone and flute, and Lake's powerful lead vocals. Their debut album, In the Court of 
             the Crimson King (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release,</p>
